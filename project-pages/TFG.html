            <strong>Introduction:</strong> This project explores the design and development of a game that leverages procedural generation to create vast, explorable solar systems. Procedural generation techniques allow the creation of unique content dynamically, reducing manual labor while enhancing variability and scalability. The focus is on generating planets, solar systems, and explorable surfaces, ensuring each environment is distinctive and immersive.
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">
            <strong>Motivation:</strong> With the gaming industry moving towards larger, more detailed worlds, procedural generation has become essential for maintaining cost-effectiveness and innovation. This project draws inspiration from games like Minecraft, No Man’s Sky, and Astroneer, which utilize similar techniques to create dynamic, limitless environments. The aim is to contribute to this field by creating a game that combines solar system exploration and planetary surface adventures.
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">
            <strong>Technologies Used:</strong> The prototype employs advanced technologies and techniques, including:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Noise Maps:</strong> For generating planetary terrain and biomes.</li>
              <li><strong>Voxels:</strong> To simulate 3D landscapes, caves, and surfaces.</li>
              <li><strong>Wave Function Collapse:</strong> For creating coherent and non-repetitive structures.</li>
              <li><strong>ShaderGraphs:</strong> Used for rendering atmospheres, lighting, and planetary details.</li>
            </ul>
            Tools like Unity and Blender were essential for the implementation, while compute shaders were leveraged to maximize GPU efficiency for procedural calculations.
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">
            <strong>Core Features:</strong> The game offers two primary gameplay experiences:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Space Exploration:</strong> Navigate a procedurally generated solar system using an intuitive spaceship control system inspired by No Man’s Sky.</li>
              <li><strong>Planetary Exploration:</strong> Explore the surface of procedurally generated planets as an astronaut, complete with caves, biomes, and material analysis tools.</li>
