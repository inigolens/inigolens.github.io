            The rapid growth of the video game industry has led to an increasing need for efficient content generation techniques. Procedural generation has emerged as a key solution, enabling the creation of vast, dynamic environments while reducing development time and costs. This project investigates and implements procedural generation techniques to develop a game prototype focused on exploring procedurally generated solar systems and planets.
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">
            The objective is to create a unique gaming experience where players navigate a solar system in a spacecraft, explore planetary surfaces, and discover diverse biomes, all generated dynamically. This project is rooted in research on procedural generation techniques and their practical application in video game development.

            The research phase involved studying procedural generation techniques widely used in the gaming industry. Key activities included:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Review of Procedural Techniques:</strong> Analyzed methods such as Noise Maps, Voxels, Wave Function Collapse, and Marching Cubes to evaluate their strengths, weaknesses, and applicability in game development.</li>
              <li><strong>Case Studies:</strong> Investigated games like <em>Minecraft</em>, <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, and <em>Astroneer</em>, identifying how procedural generation contributes to their success and gameplay mechanics.</li>
              <li><strong>Prototyping:</strong> Developed small-scale prototypes to test various techniques, including terrain generation, biome transitions, and 3D rendering, to determine their suitability for the project.</li>
